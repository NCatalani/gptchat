GPTChat
=======

GPTChat is a client for GPT-4 using the OpenAI API.

It gives GPT-4 some unique tools to be a better AI.

## A memory

GPT-4's context window is pretty small.

GPTChat adds a long term memory which GPT-4 can use to remember useful information.

For example, if you tell GPT-4 what pets you have, it'll remember and can recall that information to answer questions even when the context is gone.

## Plugins

GPT-4 can write it's own plugins to improve itself.

For example, GPT-4 is pretty bad at math and generating random numbers.

With the plugin system, you can ask GPT-4 to generate two random numbers and add them together, and it'll write a plugin to do just that.
